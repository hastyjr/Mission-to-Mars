# Mission-to-Mars
## Purpose of Project
### The purprose of this project to was to do some web-scrapping for a Mars mission. The idea was to be able to scrape different websites to get get news, facts and updated images of the data on Mars from different resources. 

### In the final submission, adjusted the web app created in the modules to include all four of the Mars hemisphere images. To do this, I use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images, stored the scraped data on a Mongo database, used a web application to display the data, and altered the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
